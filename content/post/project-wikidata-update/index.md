## Introduction
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) is a free and collaborative knowledge base that acts as a structured data repository for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. It provides a machine-readable database that is constantly evolving as users and automated bots update entries with new facts, corrections, and links.

### **Wikidata as a Triple Store**
Wikidata represents information using a **triple-based structure**, where each fact consists of:
- **Subject** → the entity (e.g., "Berlin")
- **Predicate** → the relationship (e.g., "is the capital of")
- **Object** → the value (e.g., "Germany")

This structure follows the **RDF (Resource Description Framework) model**, allowing for flexible and linked data representation.

### **How Wikidata Updates Work**
Since Wikidata is constantly changing, updates occur through a series of **insertions, deletions, and modifications**:
- **Insertion**: Adding new triples to represent new facts.
- **Deletion**: Removing outdated or incorrect triples.
- **Modification**: Changing a triple by deleting the old value and inserting a new one.

This means that **every change in Wikidata is effectively a combination of deletions and insertions**, ensuring that the data remains dynamic and accurate over time.

This report explores methods to efficiently monitor and track Wikidata updates, ensuring that we capture meaningful changes as they happen.

## Methodology

### Observing Changes on Wikidata
When examining changes on **Wikidata** through its website, each modification is displayed as a **list of styled HTML tables**. These tables visually highlight the inserted, deleted, or modified triples in a human-readable format.

While this representation is useful for manual review, it poses challenges for **machine processing and automation**. The structured changes, as displayed on the website, lack **semantic compatibility** with potential automated workflows, making it difficult to systematically track and analyze data modifications.

### Researching a Machine-Readable Approach
I researched extensively for solutions to retrieve **Wikidata changes in SPARQL Update format** ([SPARQL 1.1 Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/)). The most straightforward approach seemed to be leveraging the **Wikidata API** to capture recent changes.

The following API request retrieves recent changes from Wikidata:
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:RecentChanges

```python
api_url = "https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php"
params = {
    "action": "query",
    "list": "recentchanges",
    "rcstart": end_time,
    "rcend": start_time,
    "rclimit": CHANGE_COUNT,
    "rcprop": "title|ids|sizes|flags|user|timestamp",
    "format": "json",
    "rctype": CHANGES_TYPE,  # Limit the type of changes to edits and new entities
}
```

This request **fetches metadata** about recent changes, such as edit timestamps, user IDs, and entity IDs. However, it **does not provide the actual change data**.

## Processing Changes: Comparing Revisions

To obtain the actual modifications, my approach involved:

1. **Fetching the old and new revision IDs** from the change metadata.
2. **Making an additional API request** to compare these revisions. https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=compare.
    This api can compare two wikidata pages or two revisions of the same entity.
3. **Extracting the changes from the returned HTML table**, which is the same visual representation seen on the Wikidata website.
4. **Parsing the HTML into SPARQL Update format** and identifying the set of changed triples.

This approach initially seemed promising, but it introduced **significant workload challenges** due to:

- **Different data structures** and representations of changes in Wikidata.
- **Complexity in parsing the HTML tables** into a structured SPARQL update format while handling all edge cases.

## Challenges and Alternative Considerations

Despite extensive effort in scripting an **HTML-to-SPARQL Update** parser, I encountered an **endless loop of edge cases**. The sheer variability in how changes were formatted in Wikidata made it impractical to cover all scenarios.

After investing considerable time in refining the approach, I **decided to explore alternative solutions** that could be more scalable and reliable.


## Second Approach: Using RDF Graph Comparison

After another round of research, trial and error, and forum participation, I found another method that could be useful for the task at hand.

### **Extracting Changes Using RDF Graphs**
The most complete and correct way is:
1. **Retrieve the change metadata** using the Wikidata API.
2. **Fetch the old and new revision IDs** from the metadata.
3. **Query the entity dump for each revision ID** to obtain the full data of that entity.
4. **Parse the entity dumps into a knowledge graph** using the Python library **rdflib**.
5. **Compute the difference between the two graphs**:
   - **Graph A - Graph B** → identifies deleted triples.
   - **Graph B - Graph A** → identifies inserted triples.
6. **Generate SPARQL Update statements** based on the detected changes.

### **Advantages and Trade-offs**
This approach is **slightly slower than the first one** since for each change, **two complete Wikidata entity dumps** must be retrieved and processed. However, it ensures that:
✅ **All changes are correctly detected**  
✅ **The extracted triples are well-formatted** and consistent  
✅ **Edge cases and formatting inconsistencies are minimized**  

### **Optimizing with rdflib**
I used various **rdflib** options to **fine-tune** the method to best suit my needs, improving the processing efficiency and handling different data structures correctly.

### **Optimizing Readability with URL Translation**
To improve readability, I **utilized Python dictionaries** to **translate full URLs into Wikidata prefixes**.  
This makes the extracted triples **more concise and human-readable** while maintaining semantic accuracy.

### **Final Implementation and Testing**
This is the **approach we chose**, and we were happy with the results.  

To ensure reliability:
- **Unit tests** were added to verify that the detected changes match expected outputs.
- **Manual testing** was conducted to cross-check changes against the Wikidata interface.


Worth mentioning, multiple command-line arguments are available to tailor the project for different use cases.

## Results

After thorough research and testing, we ultimately chose the **second method**—retrieving entity dumps for each revision and computing the differences between RDF graphs. This approach, despite being slightly slower, provided **the most accurate and structured representation of changes** in **SPARQL Update format**.

### **Testing and Validation**
Once implemented, the method was rigorously tested to ensure its correctness and reliability:
- **Automated unit tests** were created to verify that the extracted insertions and deletions matched expected results.
- **Manual validation** was performed by comparing detected changes against the official Wikidata change logs.
- Edge cases, such as **complex nested structures** and **non-standard data modifications**, were tested to confirm that the solution handled a wide range of scenarios effectively.

The results demonstrated that this method **consistently captured all relevant changes**, accurately formatting them into SPARQL updates.

### **Building a Python Package**
To make the solution more accessible and reusable, I **developed a standalone Python project** based on this approach. The project was structured as a Python package, allowing for **easy installation and integration** into different workflows.  

Key features of the package include:
- A **command-line interface (CLI)** for flexibility in specifying parameters, allowing users to:
  - **Filter the number of changes** to process.
  - **Specify an entity ID** to track specific items.
  - **Select the type of change** (e.g., edit, new entity, deletion).
  - **Set a custom time period** for fetching modifications.
  - **Enable debugging options** for detailed logging and troubleshooting.
- **Customizable settings** to adapt to different user needs.
- **Efficient handling of Wikidata dumps** to ensure a structured and automated process.

By packaging the solution into a reusable project, we enabled **future users** to easily install and deploy the tool in their own applications without needing to rewrite the implementation from scratch.

## Limitations

While the implemented solution proved to be effective in tracking Wikidata changes, there were some limitations that impacted the project:

### **1. Time Constraints**  
Due to limited time, we had to make certain trade-offs in implementation and optimization. While the current method successfully retrieves and processes changes, additional refinements—such as improving performance and automating real-time tracking—could not be fully explored within the project timeline.

### **2. API Restrictions**  
The **Wikidata RecentChanges API** restricts results to the **last 500 changes** per request. This limitation makes it difficult to capture **large-scale historical modifications** or track changes over extended periods without implementing additional mechanisms, such as **periodic data fetching and storage solutions**.

Despite these constraints, the chosen approach ensures **accuracy and reliability**, making it a practical solution for structured change tracking. Future improvements could focus on **scaling the system to handle larger datasets** and **overcoming API limitations through alternative data retrieval methods**.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored various approaches to tracking **Wikidata changes** in a structured and machine-readable format. Initially, we attempted to extract changes using the **Wikidata API and HTML parsing**, but this method proved to be inefficient and difficult to generalize due to the varying structures of change representations.

After further research and experimentation, we adopted a more reliable approach—**retrieving entity dumps for each revision and computing the differences using RDF graphs**. While slightly slower, this method ensured **completeness, accuracy, and proper formatting of SPARQL Update statements**.

This project serves as a foundation for further improvements, such as **optimizing performance**, **integrating real-time tracking**, and **enhancing compatibility with other knowledge graph systems**.  

By providing an **accurate and reusable** tool, we contribute to the broader effort of **monitoring and analyzing dynamic knowledge graphs** in an efficient manner.
